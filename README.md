# Magic_GUI - A simple scoreboard for Magic: The Gathering

To get started, edit the history.json file in res/

The history.json file has the following schema:

```json
{
    "Mike": {
        "color": "purple",
        "health": 15,
        "wins": 4
    },
    "Jimmy": {
        "color": "green",
        "health": 5,
        "wins": 2
    },
    "Lori": {
        "color": "white",
        "health": 0,
        "wins": 1
    },
    "Callie": {
        "color": "blue",
        "health": 10,
        "wins": 10
    }
}
```

Any number of players can be added or removed by editing this file.
